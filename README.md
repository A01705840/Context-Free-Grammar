# Context-Free-Grammar
Evidencia 2 para TC2037 Implementation of Computational Methods

## Description
The language that I will be using for the context-free-grammar is HAL/S.

HAL/S is a programming is a programming language for real time aerospace programming. It was produce for NASA Space Shuttle Flight Software. 

HAL/S was created with the intention of having reliability, efficiency and machine independence, this means less programming training, and reuse of blocks of code for other perojects, without the access of the aerrospace hardware. (Ryer, 1978) 

RULES
1. Every program begins with the label PROGRAM
2. Comments are initiated by C at the beginning
3. All statements end with a semi-colon
4. Keyword are created by beginning a label DECLARE. Keywords are always declared before they are used. They are never 2 characters or less.
5. Variables or Identifiers can be written within 1 and 30 characters in length and can use A-Z, 9-0, and underscores (_).
6. After the label DECLARE, they come the executable statements.
7. These executable statements are WRITE, READ. After the statment, it is followed by a parenthesis with a conexion number (N)
8. At the end, there are delimiting statements, like CLOSE
9. It also contains, Operators which are logical statements.
10. And literals, which are numbers. This numbers can be represented as integer ans scalar types and does not distignuish them.
11. These literals, are not limited to '0-9' the syntaxis can have logical characters like '-, +, /, **, *, 
12. CLOSE must be the last line on every program.
